# Scala-Spark-SparkMLLib
Flight delay prediction using Scala, Spark and SparkMLLib

This project uses both Big Data and Machine Learning to show that weather can be a significant predictor of flight delays. 

## Datasets:
FLIGHT DATASET: Statistical Computing Statistical Graphics
Link: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

WEATHER DATASET: National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
Link: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00013874/detail

## Platform used to run:
https://databricks.com/

## Machine Learning algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Decision Tree
4. Randorm Forest

This project shows that combining the weather dataset with the flight dataset improves the prediction accuracy for delays in flights, hence confirming the hypothesis that weather can be a significant predictor of flight delays. This project has given me good experience with creating big data pipelines, using the databricks platform to execute Spark projects, use the Spark MLLib library to utilize out-of-the box Machine Learning algorithms for use cases, cleansing data, parsing datasets, combining large datasets based on certain fields and proving hypothesis.
